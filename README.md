# BatterySimplifiedModel

This repository contains the models from the paper:

> Xinlan Jia, Prottay M. Adhikari, and Luigi Vanfretti "Cross-Platform Real-Time Simulation Models for Li-ion Batteries in Opal-RT and Typhoon-HIL," In Proceedings of the 2020  5th Annual IEEE Texas Power and Energy Conference held on February 2-5, 2021, at Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas.

See the full paper for documentation on the models under the ./doc folder.

Under the ./source directory, you will find two sub-directories. Two subfolders for the Opal-RT and the Typhoon HIL simulator includes the real-time simulation models for each corresponding target.


## Development, Maintenance and Contribution
These models were implemented and compiled by Xinlan Jia in ALSET Lab, RPI.

Some testing was done by Prottay M. Adhikari.

The work was completed under the supervision of [Luigi Vanfretti](https://github.com/lvanfretti), who administers this repository.

Contributions are welcome via pull requests.
