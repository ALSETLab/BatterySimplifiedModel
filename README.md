# BatterySimplifiedModel

This repository contains the models from the paper:

> Xinlan Jia, Prottay M. Adhikari, and Luigi Vanfretti "Cross-Platform Real-Time Simulation Models for Li-ion Batteries in Opal-RT and Typhoon-HIL," In Proceedings of the 2020  5th Annual IEEE Texas Power and Energy Conference held on February 2-5, 2021, at Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas.

See the full paper for documentation on the models under the ./doc folder.

Under the ./source directory, you will find the "plain" Matlab/Simulink model. Two subfolders for the Opal-RT and the Typhoon HIL simulator includes the real-time simulation models for each corresponding target.
